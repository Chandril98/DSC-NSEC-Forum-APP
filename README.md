## DSC NSEC Forum App
The DSC NSEC Forum is accessible at - [forum.dscnsec.com](https://forum.dscnsec.com). We wish to create an Android/iOS app for the same. 

The application will be based on `flutter`. This will be a parallel mobile application for the DSC NSEC forum.
We will work on the design aspects and the fluency of the application. The application should work exactly like or even better than the website, and should scale fluently. Releasing an application on the play and app store would be our main concern.
